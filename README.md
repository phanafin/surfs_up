## **Overview of the Analysis** ##
This Challenge has asked us to review weather data for Oahu to help solidify the argument that they location has favorable weather to support a surf and ice cream shop.  The data involved was aquired from a variety of weather stations, and was used to give actionable information on weather trends in the month of June as well as the month of December.

## **Results** ##
As expected, June is a favorable month for summer activities.  Surfing and eating ice cream definatly rely on warmer temperatures and June certainly provides those conditions.  June in Oahu has a temperature trend as follows,

Surfing and ice cream sales would benefit, however, from year round activity.  In most areas of the United States, December does not provide temperatures that stimulate the desire to surf, nor the desire to eat ice cream.  Oahu is different.  The weather data shows little differences between the mean temperature in June versus December, which means that Oahu is condusive to the two activities all year long.

## **Summary** ##
The temperature may be favorable for surfing and eating ice cream all year long, but there are other weather related factors that should be considered before moving forward with the business decision.  The most obvious of which is the amount of precipitation that falls over the course of the year.  An unusually large amount of rainfall will dampen the desire to surf and/or eat ice cream.  In the temperature comparison, December and June are used as they tend to approach extreams in the year.  However, a monthly comparison should be used to monitor rainfall and find out if some other month has an unusual amount of rainfall than the others.  Perhaps September will be warm enough to surf, but rains a significant amount on a daily basis to thwart surf and ice cream sales.
